- **Slides of 1st lecture can be found inside Lecture1 folder in [.pdf](https://github.com/IoannisKansizoglou/DeepLectures/blob/master/Lecture1/Lecture1.pdf) (choose Download) and [.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IoannisKansizoglou/DeepLectures/master/Lecture1/Lecture1.html) (local save with Ctrl+S, internet required) format**. Whoever is interested in exploring the code about training example, the installation of jupyter notebook is required. Firstly, download and install the Anaconda environment from the official [site](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Afterwards, save Lecture1.ipynb and functions.py files in a common folder and open the first using jupyter notebook. (## .ipynb file is under evaluation ##)

- **Slides of 2nd Lecture can be found inside Lecture2 folder in [.pdf](https://github.com/IoannisKansizoglou/DeepLectures/blob/master/Lecture2/Lecture2.pdf) and [.ipynb](https://github.com/IoannisKansizoglou/DeepLectures/blob/master/Lecture2/Lecture2.ipynb) format (choose Download)**. There is no code or .gif included so pdf covers complete this lecture.

- **Also [Assignment_2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ayvk12v4viuwjqb/Assignment_2.pdf?dl=0) has been uploaded in e-class**. As described, you will develop your architectures using the **example.zip** file found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/eqc7cynuyz639z7/example.zip?dl=0).

_HOW TO USE GITHUB (WINDOWS):_ 
1. GitHub is a free online space where everyone can share and/or use other's codes through **repositories**.
2. In the [homepage of current repository](https://github.com/IoannisKansizoglou/DeepLectures) we can download the entire DeepLectures folder in .zip format choosing the **green** frame saying **Clone or Download** and then **Download ZIP**. 
3. In case we like to download a specific file we work differently. For .pdf and .ipynb files, open them with **left** click and then simply choose **Download**. For .html and .py files, open them and select **Raw** using left click. Then a new tab opens and with **right** click inside this tab choose **'Save as'** (alternatively **Ctrl+S**). When saving it, pay attention to keep .html or .py format respectively.
