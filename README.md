- **Inside Lecture1 folder slides of 1st lecture are included in [.pdf](https://github.com/IoannisKansizoglou/DeepLectures/blob/master/Lecture1/Lecture1.pdf) (choose Download) και [.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IoannisKansizoglou/DeepLectures/master/Lecture1/Lecture1.html) (online reading, localy save is required).** Whoever is interested in code format the installation of jupyter notebook is required. You can download and install the  Anaconda environment from the official [site](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Afterwards download Lecture1.ipynb and functions.py filesin a common folder and open the first using jupyter notebook. (## .ipynb file is under evaluation ##)

_HOW TO GITHUB (WINDOWS):_ 
1. GitHub is a free online space where everyone can share through **repositories** its codes or use someone's else.
2. In the [homepage of the repository](https://github.com/IoannisKansizoglou/DeepLectures) we can download the entire repository choosing the **green** frame saying **Clone or Download**. We can download it as zip.
3. In case we like to download a specific file we work as differently. For .pdf and .ipynb files we simply open them with **left** click and then we can choose **Download**. For .html and .py files we open them and we select **Raw** using left click. Then a new tab opens and with **right** click inside this tab we choose **'Save as'** (alternatively **Ctrl + S**). Pay attention when saving it to keep .html or .py format respectively.
