- **Slides of 1st lecture are included inside Lecture1 folder  in [.pdf](https://github.com/IoannisKansizoglou/DeepLectures/blob/master/Lecture1/Lecture1.pdf) (choose Download) και [.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IoannisKansizoglou/DeepLectures/master/Lecture1/Lecture1.html) (open with internet, local save with Ctrl+S)** format. Whoever is interested in exploring the code about training example, the installation of jupyter notebook is required. Firstly, download and install the Anaconda environment from the official [site](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Afterwards, save Lecture1.ipynb and functions.py files in a common folder and open the first using jupyter notebook. (## .ipynb file is under evaluation ##)

_HOW TO USE GITHUB (WINDOWS):_ 
1. GitHub is a free online space where everyone can share and/or use other's codes through **repositories**.
2. In the [homepage of current repository](https://github.com/IoannisKansizoglou/DeepLectures) we can download the entire DeepLecture folder in .zip format choosing the **green** frame saying **Clone or Download** and then **Download as ZIP**. 
3. In case we like to download a specific file we work differently. For .pdf and .ipynb files we open them with **left** click and then we simply choose **Download**. For .html and .py files we open them and we select **Raw** using left click. Then a new tab opens and with **right** click inside this tab we choose **'Save as'** (alternatively **Ctrl+S**). When saving it, pay attention to keep .html or .py format respectively.
